# Schedule Tacker

My friend has an autistic child and this app is intended to help her
and other children in the spectrum to maintain a healthy schedule.

The main goals for the app are:
- Simple, intuitive and distraction free User Interface
- Hidden configuration section
- Schedule is set by reading qr code
- Child follows the schedule and toggles completion of tasks
- If set, alerts are sent according to the schedule
